# Fake News Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting fake news using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It includes advanced implementations such as **Word2Vec**, **GloVe** embeddings, and neural networks like the **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** to classify news articles as either **fake** or **real**. By processing large datasets of news articles and training models on these features, the project aims to accurately detect misleading or false information.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset of news articles.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks containing code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Saved models including Word2Vec, GloVe embeddings, neural networks, and traditional classifiers.
- **results/**: Folder where predictions, performance metrics, and visualizations are saved.
- **README.md**: This file, explaining the project details.

## Data
The dataset used in the project contains:
- **Title**: The headline of the news article.
- **Text**: The full body of the article.
- **Label**: Classification of the article (0 for real, 1 for fake).

You can place the dataset in the `data/` folder.

## Models and Techniques
This project uses both traditional machine learning models and deep learning approaches, including:

### 1. **Word2Vec and GloVe Embeddings**
- **Word2Vec**: A popular word embedding technique that learns vector representations of words from large corpora, capturing semantic relationships between words. It is used to represent news articles in a numerical format for machine learning models.
  
- **GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation)**: Another word embedding technique that focuses on global word co-occurrence to produce dense vector representations. GloVe is used to create word vectors that enhance the feature set for text classification.

### 2. **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- A deep neural network model consisting of multiple layers of neurons. It is used to classify news articles based on their word embeddings, capturing complex relationships between features to improve classification accuracy.

### 3. **Logistic Regression**
- A baseline machine learning model for binary classification. Logistic Regression is applied to classify fake vs. real news articles based on their features.

### 4. **Random Forest**
- An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy. It works effectively with high-dimensional data, like word embeddings from Word2Vec and GloVe.

### 5. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- A classification model that creates hyperplanes to separate fake and real news articles based on the features extracted from the text.

## Feature Engineering
Key feature engineering techniques applied include:
- **Text Cleaning**: Removal of stopwords, punctuation, and special characters.
- **Tokenization and Lemmatization**: Breaking text into tokens and reducing words to their base forms.
- **Word2Vec and GloVe Embeddings**: Converting text into numerical vectors for use in machine learning models.
- **TF-IDF**: Extracting important features based on the frequency of words in the corpus.

## Visualization
The project includes comprehensive visualizations for understanding the data and model performance:
- **Word Clouds**: Visualize common words in fake and real news articles.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visual representation of classification performance.
- **ROC Curve**: Evaluates true positive rates against false positive rates for model comparison.

## Installation
### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - nltk
  - tensorflow (for neural networks)
  - gensim (for Word2Vec)
  - glove-python-binary (for GloVe embeddings)

## Usage
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess text data, removing noise and preparing it for model training.
- **Feature Extraction**: Apply Word2Vec and GloVe embeddings to transform text into numerical vectors.
- **Model Training**: Train models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and MLP on the extracted features.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to total instances.
- **Precision**: Measures the proportion of true positives among all predicted positives.
- **Recall**: Measures the proportion of actual positives correctly predicted.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
- **ROC-AUC Score**: Evaluates how well the model distinguishes between classes.

## Results
The results of the predictions and model evaluations are saved in the `results/` folder, including:
- Confusion matrices for all models.
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 scores for each model.
- Visualizations such as word clouds and ROC curves.

## Future Work
- Experiment with advanced NLP models like **BERT** or **Transformer** architectures to improve performance.
- Enhance the model by including external features such as social media signals or article metadata.
- Incorporate additional deep learning techniques, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for text processing.
